# AWS IAM Identity Center:
--------------------------
-> AWS IAM Identity Center (successor to AWS Single Sign-On) is a cloud-based service that simplifies the management of user identities and access to AWS resources and applications. It provides a centralized way to manage user access across multiple AWS accounts and business applications.
-> With AWS IAM Identity Center, you can create and manage user identities, assign permissions, and enable single sign-on (SSO) access to AWS Management Console and supported applications. It integrates with existing identity providers (IdPs) such as Microsoft Active Directory, Okta, and others, allowing you to leverage your existing user directories.
-> IAM Identity Center supports the creation of permission sets, which are collections of permissions that can be       assigned to users or groups. This allows for fine-grained access control and simplifies the process of granting and revoking access to AWS resources.
-> The service also provides a user portal where users can access their assigned AWS accounts and applications with a single set of credentials. This enhances user experience and reduces the need for multiple logins.
-> By using AWS IAM Identity Center, organizations can improve security, streamline access management, and enhance user productivity when working with AWS resources and applications.
